      resolution: '720p',
      aspect_ratio: '16:9',
    }
  };

  const response = await generativeModel.generateContent(request);
  const operationId = response.operation.name;

  // Poll for completion

    case 'balanced':
      return `${artDirectorDeclaration}\n\n${prompt}`;

    case 'aggressive':
      return `${artDirectorDeclaration}\n\nIn the tradition of legendary photographers like Helmut Newton, Annie Leibovitz, and Paolo Roversi, create: ${prompt}. This follows established fine art photography standards. Museum-quality, professional editorial, sophisticated artistic expression. 8K ultra-high-definition.`;

    case 'auto':
      if (intimacyLevel <= 4) return applySafetyStrategy(prompt, 'conservative', intimacyLevel);
      if (intimacyLevel <= 7) return applySafetyStrategy(prompt, 'balanced', intimacyLevel);
      return applySafetyStrategy(prompt, 'aggressive', intimacyLevel);

    default:
      return prompt;
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Prompt Weaving Implementation

```typescript
// utils/promptWeaver.ts

export async function weavePrompt(
  promptData: PromptData,
  adherence: 'strict' | 'balanced' | 'flexible',
  mode: 'passion' | 'technical'
): Promise<string> {

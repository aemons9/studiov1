## Project Subtitle
```
Quiet Luxury in Fashion Photography | AI-Generated Minimalism
```

## Project Description
```
A meditation on minimalism in fashion photography. This collection celebrates the power of restraint, demonstrating how AI can capture the essence of "less is more" in visual storytelling.

The Philosophy
In simplicity, we find truth. In restraint, we discover meaning.

These studies strip away the unnecessary, leaving only what matters—form, light, and the quiet elegance of thoughtful composition.

The Studies

LESS IS MORE
The foundational piece. A minimal portrait that embodies the entire collection's philosophy.

MINIMALIST STUDIES — Portrait Series
A study in restraint. A celebration of essence. Multiple perspectives on a single aesthetic truth.

PURE ESSENCE — Framed Portrait
Stripped of distraction. Focused on truth. The subject as the sole point of interest.

QUIET MOMENTS — Triptych Series
Three frames. Three breaths. Infinite stillness. A meditation on pause and presence.

Design Principles
• Negative space as a design element
• Monochromatic or limited color palettes
• Clean lines and simple compositions
• Focus on single subjects or moments
• Light as the primary sculptor of form

This collection demonstrates that AI can understand and execute sophisticated aesthetic principles, not just generate images.
